For creating chat bots you have basic knowladge of AI, LLMS, RAG applications, Langchain Framework, Fine tuning.
You need to know how AI works like (Tokenning, Embedding, Embedding Vectors, Transformers, Text generation, Decoder).

For basic coding you need python and for editor you can use any like (vscode,pycharm)
First you have to install this librarys for that you open terminal of your code editor and then type
    pip install streamlit langchain PyPDF2 faiss-cpu
